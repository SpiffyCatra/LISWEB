 <h1 class="text-center"> Life Is So Strange </h1>
<p class="purple--text"> Life is strange is a decision making game that asks the player a specific question. "If you could turn
back the clock, would you do it?" The game gives you the power to go back into time, often allowing you to retract a decision or even
undo an action. You play as Max Caulfield as every decision you make or do not make effect the people around you. The game makes it
that in most cases there is no right or wrong decision but instead, a cause and effect set of instances. 
for only the most gayest queers imaginable. *cough cough* Me, clearly. Since it came out on 
January 30th, 2015 it has become a little dated, still holding a charm of slang and aesthetic used in that year.</p>
