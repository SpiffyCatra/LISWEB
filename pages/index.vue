 <h1 class="text-center"> Life Is So Strange </h1>
<p class="purple--text"> Life is strange is a decision making game designed for only the most gayest queers imaginable. *cough cough* Me, clearly. Since it came out in 
January 30th, 2015 it has been loved by many tumblr, amino and instagram users. Life is Strange follows a young college student by the name of
Max Caulfield as she finds that her gay ass self has some pretty gay ass power to rewind time.</p>
<h2> Max Caulfield</h2>
